Create mixed reality visualizations in Jupyter Notebooks

## Rapid Mixed Reality Visualizations

pyReality makes it easy to create mixed reality data visualizations in Jupyter Notebooks. It leverages the capabilities of Jupyter Notebooks to let users modify the data visualization using their desktop computer while they view it using a head-mounted display (HMD). Currently, pyReality provides two visualization types i.e. 3D scatterplots and 3D bar charts. More visualizations will be added later. pyReality makes it easy to rapidly create mixed reality visualizations without having to use multiple software to model and render.
